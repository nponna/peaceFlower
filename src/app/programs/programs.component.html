    <h4> Our Curriculum </h4>
    <p>  In addition to focusing on reading and writing, in our curriculum include Practical life, Sensorial, Math, Science and Cultural. We also emphasize a child’s physical, emotional and creative development. We incorporate Arts, Yoga, Creative exploration, Science projects, Music and Movement  and foreign languages Spanish and Chinese will be provided in the future. </p>

It is therefore important to “Teach teaching, not correcting” (Montessori) in order to allow the child to be a fully functional member in his own society. Practical Life activities, prepare the child for reading and writing by helping the child to control their body.<br/>

The Montessori materials for age 2 1/2 to 6 are designed to help the child’s and develop the necessary skills for later intellectual learning. Use of these materials constitutes the next level of difficulty after those of practical life. The child’s repetitive use of sensorial materials helps the child to develop order, concentration, coordination, and independence. As the child gains self-confidence they gain inner discipline. They also become normalized in a process known as “normalization”.

As the child develops a sense of order, they learn to concentrate. The coordination helps them improve and learn to work independently. The materials provided in the class room help the child enrich their language skills along with opportunities  such as conversations, stories, and poetry. Phonetic skills and the study of grammar help children to develop their reading skill, sequencing, classification, and gradation activity lay the groundwork for both reading and math. During the process of child development, language development is one of the crucial steps as it aids the child’s natural development of verbal communication and literacy. An observant teacher, an environmentally prepared class room, and the appropriate materials will prepare the child for language readiness and development at an early age.

              <td>Mathematics is a language for understanding and expressing measurable relationships that are inherent in our life experiences. We often think that mathematics is difficult because we have been introduced to it at an abstract level, with our the clarification of concrete experiences.Learning comes such more easily when children work with the concrete educational materials that graphically show what is taking place in a given mathematical process. Maria Montessori introduced children to use hands on learning material that  makes abstract concepts clear and concrete in a Montessori class. <br/> <br/>
              In the Montessori math curriculum, all the math materials are graded from simple to complex and concept to abstract. The child’s mathematical mind tends to estimate and be able to quantify, see the identity, similarity, difference, patters, and make the order, sequence, and control the error. Montessori mathematics materials dress nature of child in the development of the willpower, in self-discipline and ground rules. The child learns patience and self-control as he follows the ground rules. He develops self-discipline as he works on the materials and is able to follow the rules. By comparing all the facts that a mathematical mind should have, we can say that  the Montessori math curriculum is skillfully designed to suit the child’s need for grouping up with mathematical mind.

Earth Science nurtures children’s fascination with the universe and helps them develop lifelong interest in observing nature. It also introduces the idea that children are connected to the earth and how that idea enables them to discover more about the world in which we are living. <br/> <br/>
              In a developmentally appropriate Montessori classroom everything should be organized in such a way that will spark the imagination for the children. In Geology, children are introduced to all kinds of rocks and asked to classify them by their characteristics. The Montessori curriculum introduces history and geography as early as age three. In the early years, children are given concrete examples, stories and pictures of people all over the world. This helps in building a foundation in geography and history for the child. Because of this, children will start working with specially designed maps and begin to examine their own cultural heritage as well as others.
