"We will maintain sanitized and un-sanitized bins so that each time a child finishes with his or her work, all materials (activities, blocks, pencils, brushes, etc.) will immediately be put away in un-sanitized bins.",
"During snack time we will also maintain 6 feet between each child and keep them within the same group and with the same teacher.",
"We are not providing any meals during this period and the child should get their own meals. As backup, we will keep light snacks like cereal, crackers, and fruits and provide them as needed.",
"We will frequently guide children and teachers to wash hands with soap and water during each transition.",
"During outside playtime, each group will go with the same teacher. After one group playtime is over, we will sanitize play equipment and toys before allowing the other group to go outside."
