Montessori education emphasizes learning through all five senses - sight, touch, taste, smell and hearing. Children in Montessori classes learn at their own pace and through their own choice of activities available to them, thereby creating a myriad of possibilities. Peace Flower provides a carefully prepared Montessori environment which promotes and fosters learning satisfaction through discovery and joy in achievement. We focus on encouraging children to learn at their own pace.";
