Our program, aimed for children ages 3-6 years, is guided by American Montessori Society (AMS) trained teachers who play a critical role in the development of the child’s personality and intellect. Together with our balanced curriculum, inspired teachers, collaborative environment, and inviting physical space, we are committed to helping your children grow into mature, compassionate, autonomous individuals. At PFM, we have carefully designed indoor classrooms, outdoor playgrounds, and our curriculum to be conducive to the world your child sees outside of school. Our well trained and experienced teachers develop creative lesson plans that engages children and fosters learning in these various of environments. Our low teacher to student ratio and age continuous rooms enables children to not only build strong relationships with their teachers but also build relationships with one another by teaching and learning from each other. In the PFM curriculum, we also take time to focus on special events (i.e. Mother’s day), field trips, and etc. to connect classroom education with real life. Here at Peace Flower Montessori, we strive to provide your child with all the resources they need to achieve their dreams.";
